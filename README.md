# This repository is for Mechatronics class @SeoulTech
There are three motor control project, 1. DC motor, 2. Stepping Motor, 3. BLDC motor.

## DC motor project 
- focused on PID control system

## Stepping motor project
- focused on motor driving
- open-loop control

## BLDC motor project
- focused on both PID control and motor driving
